Application based on searching algorithm where the searching results must be generated as fast as it could be. 
In order to cope with that, different approaches have been implemented, one of them using functional programming. 
The project unfolds two solutions. 

Main functionality:

The main search bar provides instant set of results as the user types in the wanted request, in our case it would be names of diverse recipes (cheese cake).

Advanced Search: 

The advanced search on other hand gives the possibility to narrow the request based on the results generated out of the main input. 
The user can unfold three main containers bearing labels "Ingredients, Appliance, Utensils". From the latter, the user can select a tag which will serve as the filter to get the requested results.
